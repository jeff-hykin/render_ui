- Things try to send data to this render service
    - 3d data (objects)
    - 2d data (lines, shapes, etc)
    - viewpoints
    - meta info (preferred color, time-value)
    - the frontend can connect data sources to different render zones
    - the frontend can intercept data and modify it before sending it to the render service
- Ideally the protocol allows for low latency
    - e.g. instead of sending all the data about all the objects, it could send the movement, scale, rotation, etc of an object
- 3D actions:
    - create box
    - create camera
