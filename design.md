- Data Sources
    - Link a name to a url/port/credentials etc
    - Starting out: just an input panel for a url
    - All have a namespace
    - TODO: consider the play/pause design
- Transformers
    - Take some kind of data and transform it with a function
    - Have a checker for acceptable data input format
- Playback (of some kind) tied to each data source

- Render Zones
    - Visual areas on the screen that receive updates from data sources
    - Eventually: 2D, 3D, and JSON-data rendering zones
        - Handles plots/graphs/maps
    - Starting out: a fixed size 3D rendering zone
    - ## Visualizers:
        - Take some kind of data and render it in a visual way
            - Take per-source settings
            - Checkboxes for enable/disabling visual elements
        - Different depending on the render zone
        - Types:
            - Static: (background, map, etc)
            - Stateless: message data directly becomes a visual update
            - Stateful: needs a history (for playback/rewind)
                - Much more complex and difficult to do efficiently
    - ## Hooks:
        - Connect a data source to a visualizer
